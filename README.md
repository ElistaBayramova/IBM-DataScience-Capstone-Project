SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction
 The goal was to develop a model to predict if the first stage of 
the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. SpaceX data 
was collected using various methods like API and Web Scraping. After 
accomplishing Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis to predict if the first 
stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully ML models were 
developed. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest 
Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree algorithms were tested.
